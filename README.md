# DNN-for-Polar-codes
Python implementation of a DNN decoder for polar codes
It is a basic DNN decoder for Polar codes with optimal structure of a neural network. 
The structure of neural network is based on parameters in study Decoding of Polar Code by Using Deep Feed-Forward Neural Networks
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8390279)
The coding part of a code is done with a help of this polar codes implementation https://github.com/RQC-QApp/polar-codes.
